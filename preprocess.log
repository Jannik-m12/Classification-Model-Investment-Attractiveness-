## Preprocessing Steps Log

- Loaded raw data from Data/Raw/global-data-on-sustainable-energy.csv
- Dropped target columns from features
- Split data into train/validation/test by year
- Replaced infinite values with NaN
- Applied KNN imputation to missing values (fit on train only)
- Scaled numeric features using StandardScaler (fit on train only)
- Cleaned column names (removed special characters)
- Dropped 'Entity' and 'Year' columns from modeling features
- Dropped rows with remaining missing values
- Aligned target variable indices after dropping rows
- Exported preprocessing pipeline as joblib
- Verified no data leakage between splits
- Saved processed datasets for modeling
