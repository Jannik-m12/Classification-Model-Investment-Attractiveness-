## FeatureTools is not adding new features because the data structure does not provide the relationships or hierarchies it needs for automated feature synthesis



# Automated Feature Engineering: Feature Selection Rationale

This document records the automated features generated by FeatureTools, and documents which features were retained or discarded for modeling, along with the rationale for each decision.

## Retained Features
- (To be filled: List the names of the most promising automated features you select for modeling, e.g. those with high importance, strong correlation with target, or clear interpretability.)
- Example:
  - `Entity__mean_Renewable_capacity_growth_5y`: Retained. Captures average renewable growth by country, which is highly relevant to investment attractiveness.
  - `Fossil_share__trend`: Retained. Captures the trend in fossil fuel share, which is a key risk factor for sustainable investment.

## Discarded Features
- (To be filled: List the names of features you discard, e.g. due to redundancy, high missingness, or lack of interpretability.)
- Example:
  - `index__sum_CO2_emissions`: Discarded. Highly correlated with total electricity, adds little new information.
  - `Entity__skew_GDP_per_capita`: Discarded. Skewness not directly interpretable for investment decisions.

## Rationale for Feature Selection
- Retained features were selected based on:
  - High feature importance in tree-based models
  - Strong correlation with the target variable
  - Clear business or domain interpretability
  - Low missingness and robust calculation
- Discarded features were removed due to:
  - High redundancy with existing features
  - High missingness or unreliable calculation
  - Lack of clear interpretability or business value
