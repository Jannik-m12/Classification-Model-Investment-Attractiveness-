## Dataset Decision Matrix

Here is a template for a dataset decision matrix. You can score the current dataset (or potential alternative datasets) based on these criteria to help make informed decisions.

| Criterion | Score (e.g., 1-5) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Alignment**<br>(How well does the dataset align with the problem you're trying to solve?) | 4 | The dataset contains a wide range of relevant energy, environmental, and socioeconomic indicators at the country level, directly aligning with the factors identified as influencing sustainable energy investment attractiveness. |
| **Scale**<br>(Is the dataset large enough and does it have sufficient variety for your modeling needs?) | 3 | The dataset has a moderate volume (~3600 country-year observations) and high variety of features, which is sufficient for initial modeling. However, more granular data (e.g., regional within countries, project-level) could offer greater scale and detail for more complex models. |
| **Ethics**<br>(Are there any ethical concerns with the dataset, such as sensitive attributes or bias?) | 4 | The dataset is aggregated at the country level and does not contain personal or sensitive attributes. The main ethical consideration is potential bias in historical data reflecting existing inequalities, which needs careful consideration during model interpretation and deployment. |
| **Cost**<br>(What are the costs associated with using the dataset, including acquisition, storage, and processing?) | 5 | This dataset is publicly available and relatively small, resulting in low acquisition, storage, and processing costs. |

**Overall Recommendation:** Based on the scores and rationale above, this dataset is **suitable** for this project because it aligns well with the problem, has sufficient scale and variety for initial modeling, presents minimal direct ethical concerns (though bias needs monitoring), and has very low costs. It provides a strong foundation for developing a predictive model for sustainable energy investment attractiveness.
