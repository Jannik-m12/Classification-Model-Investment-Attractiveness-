## Dataset Alignment Statement

We chose the "Global Data on Sustainable Energy" dataset for this classification problem. It covers various energy, environmental, and socioeconomic indicators for numerous countries from 2000 to 2020. The dataset's classes, implicitly defined by the columns, are well-aligned with our prediction task of identifying countries attractive for sustainable energy investment, as they include key factors like renewable energy capacity, GDP growth, and electricity access.

The dataset is technically fit due to its relevant features and time-series nature, allowing for time-aware modeling. Ethically, it's suitable as it contains no sensitive personal data, being aggregated at the country level.

Remaining gaps include potential data inconsistencies or missing values not fully handled by imputation, and the need for more granular data (e.g., sub-country level) for finer-grained predictions. We plan to address remaining missing values by carefully considering imputation strategies or dropping affected rows if necessary, and acknowledge the limitation of country-level data while focusing on the broader investment attractiveness.
